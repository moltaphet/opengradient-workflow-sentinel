# 🛡️ OpenGradient Infrastructure & Workflow Monitor

An advanced diagnostic suite designed for the **OpenGradient Alpha Network**. This tool provides real-time visibility into on-chain AI workflows, operator health, and decentralized infrastructure stability.

## 🚀 Overview
During the early Alpha stage of the OpenGradient SDK, maintaining a stable connection and verifying deployments is crucial. This project bridges the gap between deployment and production-grade monitoring by providing a comprehensive telemetry dashboard.

## ✨ Key Features
* **On-Chain Workflow Verification**: Automatically tracks and validates the status of AI model workflows (Active ID: `0x8cD17D75f936EB6c13DDacB9d77fC771102d8765`).
* **Operator Audit**: Real-time authentication check using ECDSA (Secp256k1) to ensure the operator is authorized and connected.
* **Network Telemetry**: Monitors RPC status, data layer synchronization, and node latency to ensure optimal inference conditions.
* **Future-Proofing**: Fully optimized to run on **Python 3.14**, overcoming internal SDK attribute shifts through custom diagnostic logic.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language**: Python 3.14+
* **Network**: OpenGradient Alpha Testnet
* **Core SDK**: `opengradient` (Alpha branch)
* **Security**: Private Key based ECDSA Authentication
